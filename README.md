About
------

I am Manuel Paez, a Fourth-Year Computer Science B.A. student at Columbia University. I am currently a Research Assistant under Szabolcs Márka in Columbia's Department of Physics and a Research Intern in the Chklovskii Group for Neural Circuits and Algorithms at Simons Foundation's Flatiron Institute. I previously worked under Kiyohito Iigaya in Columbia's Department of Psychiatry. I am also referred to as Manny. I speak English, Deutsch, Français, Español, and 한국어. 

Research Interests
------
 
My research aims are centered around constructing a rigorous foundation for the algorithmic theories and cryptographic tools necessary for a quantum-supremacy world. As quantum machines present endless possibilities compared to classical machines, particularly in algorithms, cryptography, and cryptanalysis, I want to design novel algorithms and cryptographic protocols necessary for securing our future. I desire to explore these five main questions from Quantum Algorithms, Complexity, and Cryptography:

1. What computational problems can a quantum machine solve that a classical machine with comparable resources cannot (such as NP-search problems)?

2. Related to question 1, what are the quantum algorithms that speed up computational problems compared to a classical machine with comparable resources (particularly in search and graph problems)?

3. What cryptography protocols can be constructed such that it is hard for a quantum machine to solve, even if implemented on a classical machine?

4. How can better develop a secure Device-Independent Quantum Key Distribution (pure-quantum) cryptographic protocol against quantum-machine attacks?

5. How can quantum machines and their complexity classes help us solve complexity class problems, such as if P = NP?
 
I hope to explore these questions and similar questions alike while pursuing a Ph.D. candidacy. My research aims are centered around pursuing my ultimate dream: to create neuromorphic quantum machines and to create a quantum machine that is encoded with a sentience and consciousness comparable to a human mind. 

Aside from research, my hobbies includes solving logic puzzles (like MIT Mystery Hunt stuff) reading books (particularly International Literature, Sci-fi, and the Classics), engaging with the Arts (Art Galleries, Operas, Philharmonics, etc.), traveling, and watching Bayern Munich. I am also a Mocha Coffee Enthusiast and a huge fan of neo-futurism. I also love sci-fi, particularly Ghost in the Shell and Blade Runner.
