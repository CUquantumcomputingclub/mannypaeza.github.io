About
------

I am Manuel Paez, a Fourth-Year Computer Science B.A. student at Columbia University. I am currently a Research Assistant under Szabolcs Márka in Columbia's Department of Physics and a Research Intern in the Chklovskii Group for Neural Circuits and Algorithms at Simons Foundation's Flatiron Institute. I previously worked under Kiyohito Iigaya in Columbia's Department of Psychiatry. I am also referred to as Manny. I speak English, Deutsch, Français, Español, and 한국어. 

Research Interests
------
 
My current research aims are to build a rigorous foundation for exploring how the intersections of Artificial Intelligence, Quantum Information Sciences, Computational Neuroscience, and Cryptography can advance Artificial Intelligence, Signals Intelligence, and Mind-Machine Capacities. With this rigorous foundation, I seek to discover new algorithmic tools and theories that enhance the ability to carry out these functions.
 
I utilize skills from Quantum Information Sciences, Theoretical and Computational Neuroscience, Machine Learning, Algebra, Topology, Number Theory, and Cryptography to study these five main questions:
* How can we intersect neuro-AI with quantum computing to create better and more advanced Artificial Intelligence? 
* How can quantum machines efficiently learn and accurately predict complex quantum many-body systems, especially for modeling our mathematical models and theories of the universe? 
* How can novel quantum-algorithms designs achieve better speed-ups on quantum machines than classical machines? 
* What mathematical structures can be implemented for post-quantum supremacy cryptography on both classical and quantum machines? 
* How can quantum algorithms advance cryptanalysis, cyberattack, and signal intelligence tools and systems?
 
My ultimate dream is to build a sentient, autonomous Artificial Intelligence that operates on a Quantum Computer and a Quantum-Mind Interface for Humans (similar to the Cyber-Brains in the anime/manga Ghost in the Shell).

Aside from research, my hobbies includes solving logic puzzles (like MIT Mystery Hunt stuff) reading books (particularly International Literature, Sci-fi, and the Classics), engaging with the Arts (Art Galleries, Operas, Philharmonics, etc.), traveling, and watching Bayern Munich. I am also a Mocha Coffee Enthusiast.
