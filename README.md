Manuel Paez
======

I am Manuel Paez (Manny), a fourth-year Computer Science B.A student at Columbia University. I am currently a Research Assistant under Szabolc Marka and a
Research Intern in the Chklovskii Group at Simons Foundation Flatiron Institute. I speak English, Deutsch, Français, Español, and 한국어. 

Research Interests
------
 
My current research aims are to build a rigorous foundation for exploring how the intersections of Artificial Intelligence, Quantum Information Sciences, Cpmputational Neuroscience, and Cryptography can improve Signals Intelligence and Mind-Machine Capacities. With this rigorous foundation, I seek to discover new algorithmic tools and theories that enhance the ability to carry out these functions.
 
I utilize skills from Quantum Information Sciences, Theoretical and Computational Neuroscience, Machine Learning, Algebra, Topology, Number Theory, and Cryptography to study these five main questions:
* How can we intersect Neuroscience, particularly Computational Neuroscience, with Quantum Computing to create better and more advanced Artificial Intelligence?
* How can we intersect Neuroscience, Neurotechnology, and Quantum Computing for Mind-Machine Interfaces (Computer-Brain)?
* How can Quantum Artificial Intelligence advance data analysis and processing, specifically for signal intelligence use?
* How can Quantum Artificial Intelligence and Quantum Cryptography advance infiltrating computer systems and communications systems (Quantum Cryptanalysis) for Signals Intelligence?
* How can Quantum Sciences advance Cryptography for Computer and Communication Systems?
 
My ultimate dream is to build a sentient, autonomous Artificial Intelligence that operates on a Quantum Computer and a Quantum-Mind Interface for Humans?

Aside from research, my hobbies include reading books (particularly International Literature and Classics), engaging with the Arts, Traveling, and watching Bayern Munich play.
